# Meals
Calculate my macros for the day. Provide a breakdown of grams of carbs, fats, and protein. Also include calories. With protein, divide into animal protein and plant protein. For fats, divide into saturated, monosaturated, and trans fat. Breakdown carbs into complex, sugars, and fiber. Estimate the macros using the local food_db.yaml and, if not there, online sources such as usda. Put a summary in markdown format in a file called my_foods.yaml. Keep a log of new foods you found in the food_db.yaml file. Also calculate the percentage daily value of each macronutrient. Note if carbs or fat are in excess.
