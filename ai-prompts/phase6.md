Create a labeling system. Each recipe should have a section called labels. Users should be able to specify a markdown list of different labels. We should be able to filter recipes by different labels in the meal page.

The labeling section should be optional. By default, the name of the parent directory of the food should automatically be considered a label of the food.

The set of all labels should be compiled into a markdown file by searching all recipes in the recipe folder.
