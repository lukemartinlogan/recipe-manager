Create a labeling system. Recipes can have an optional section called labels. Users should be able to specify a markdown list of different labels to categorize this food. We should be able to filter recipes by different labels in the meal page. By default, the name of the parent directory of the food should automatically be considered a label of the food.

The set of all labels should be compiled into a markdown file by searching all recipes in the recipe folder.

Labels should appear as a section containing checkboxes for each label. It does not need to be in the main menu, but should appear as the first section.

Implement a method to link to other recipes by the name of their markdown file. For example, coconut curry may have a section called "Sides" that recommends sides to cook along with the recipe

Make it so when something is crossed off the grocery list, it will go to the bottom of the grocery list.

Also make it so that I can change the quantity of meals in the meal section of the grocery list.
