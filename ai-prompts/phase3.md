# Grocery List Extension

We want to be able to select a set of meals and produce a grocery list of items that are needed. 

## Main Page

In the main page, each meal tile should have a quantity form within the tile indicating how much of the meal to add to the grocery list. By default all entries are 0. When clicking on a meal tile, the quantity in the recipe should be the same as the meal quantity.

## Grocery List Page

There should be two sections

### Ingredients

A list of ingredients to purchase, where each entry begins with a checkbox. It should not contain the total qunaity of ingredients, just the set of ingredient names.

### Meal

A set of meal tiles and the quantity of the meal used for the ingredients. Should be just a digest of the original main page with meals that have more than 0 quantity. 

At the bottom of this page there should be a "Purchased" button. This will reset all meal quantities to 0.
