### Aromatics
- [ ] $garlic = 3 cloves, chopped$

### Oil and Liquid

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven at 350°F (180°C)
2. Cut $potatoes$ and $eggplants$ in about 2 inch pieces, the $zucchini$ in 1/2 inch slices. The $onions$ in quarters and $bell_pepper$ in slices
3. Pour all the vegetables in a large bowl. Add $garlic$, $dry_mint$, $parsley$, $oregano$. Mix
4. Mix the $tomato_paste$ with a bit of $water$ (1 tablespoon) and add to the vegetables
5. Add the $olive_oil$ and mix well. We usually do it with our hands
6. Add $salt$ to taste and $black_pepper$, and mix some more (add very little salt and add more if needed when serving)
7. Transfer the vegetables to a large shallow pan, it should be able to fit all the vegetables in one layer
8. Pour in a corner of the pan about 1/3 cup $water$ and tilt the pan so that it spreads, but don't pour it over the vegetables. Pour more later if it seems like they are becoming dry
9. Cover with aluminum foil and roast for about an hour
10. After an hour check and see if the vegetables are cooked (you should be able to stick a fork in them easily)
11. If they are cooked, remove the foil and roast for another 30-45 minutes until the $potatoes$ start turning golden brown
12. Let it cool and serve with bread and feta cheese. You can also serve cold
