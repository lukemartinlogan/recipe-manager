**Servings:** 8  
**Author:** Lisa Fain

## Ingredients

### Pie Filling
- [ ] $cocoa = 4 tbsp cocoa (or 1 1/2 squares baking chocolate)$
- [ ] $sugar = 3/4 cup sugar$
- [ ] $flour = 5 tbsp all-purpose flour$
- [ ] $salt = 1/4 tsp salt$
- [ ] $egg_yolks = 2 egg yolks, lightly beaten$
- [ ] $milk = 1 1/2 cups whole milk$
- [ ] $vanilla = 1/2 tsp vanilla$
- [ ] $butter = 1 tbsp butter$
- [ ] $piecrust = 1 unbaked 9-inch piecrust$

### Meringue
- [ ] $egg_whites = 2 egg whites$
- [ ] $meringue_salt = 1/8 tsp kosher salt$
- [ ] $meringue_sugar = 4 tbsp sugar$

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. In a saucepot, whisk together $cocoa$, $sugar$, $flour$, $salt$, $egg_yolks$, and $milk$.

3. On medium heat, cook while stirring until it bubbles and thickens, about 5 to 10 minutes. If it becomes lumpy, just beat out the lumps. (It will not get any thicker in the oven so cook until it's as thick as you want it.)

4. Remove the chocolate filling from the heat and stir in $vanilla$ and $butter$.

5. Meanwhile, as you make the custard, poke holes in the $piecrust$ with a fork and bake it until it's brown, about 20 minutes.

6. To make the meringue, beat $egg_whites$ with $meringue_salt$ and when they start to get fluffy add $meringue_sugar$.

7. Pour the chocolate custard into the baked pie shell and top with the beaten egg whites. Bake it until the peaks on the meringue are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Serve warm.

**Grandma says:** "It's real good hot, wonderful cold and you can even eat it frozen—then it's like a popsicle!"
