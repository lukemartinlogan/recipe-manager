[recipe_icon](protein-balls.jpg)

## Ingredients
### Base
- [ ] $peanut_butter = 1 cup, drippy all-natural$
- [ ] $protein_powder = 1/3 cup, vanilla$
- [ ] $rolled_oats = 1/2 cup$
- [ ] $chia_seeds = 1 tbsp$

### Sweetener and Mix-ins
- [ ] $honey = 2 tbsp$
- [ ] $mini_chocolate_chips = 1/4 cup$

### Liquid
- [ ] $water = 1-4 tsp$

## Instructions
1. Place $peanut_butter$, $protein_powder$, $rolled_oats$, $chia_seeds$, $honey$, and $mini_chocolate_chips$ into a medium bowl
2. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to mix the dough together. At this point, begin to add $water$ by the teaspoon
3. Depending on how drippy your $peanut_butter$ is, you'll need to add more or less $water$. The water not only helps moisten things so your balls hold shape, but they actually help your balls become less chalky
4. Use a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop dough into your palms. Roll into balls until all dough is gone. You should get somewhere between 14-16 balls
5. Store in the refrigerator for up to a week or in the freezer for up to 3 months
