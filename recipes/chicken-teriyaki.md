# Chicken Teriyaki

## Ingredients
- ½ cup low sodium soy sauce
- ¼ cup water
- 3 tablespoons packed brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons honey, or pure maple syrup
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon olive oil, avocado oil or canola oil
- 1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch bite-sized pieces
- black pepper, to taste
- cooked rice, for serving
- chopped green onions and/or sesame seeds, optional, for serving

## Instructions
1. Combine the soy sauce, water, brown sugar, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk until well combined.
2. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and season with pepper. Let the chicken brown on the first side for a few minutes and then flip, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until cooked through. (This will take about 7-10 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken pieces. Thighs take a bit longer to cook through than chicken breasts.) If the pan gets too hot, reduce the heat to medium.
3. Whisk the sauce again to make sure everything is well combined and then pour the sauce into the pan with the chicken. Cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce thickens.
4. Serve chicken and sauce over rice, topped with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.
