# Beer Batter Fillet

## Ingredients
- [ ] $fish = 2 lbs cod or haddock fillet, cut into portions$
- [ ] $beer = 24 oz IPA or pale ale, citrusy, fruity, hoppy IPAs are best$
- [ ] $flour = 2 cups all-purpose flour$
- [ ] $dredging_flour = 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging$
- [ ] $garlic_powder = 1/2 tsp garlic powder$
- [ ] $onion_powder = 1/2 tsp onion powder$
- [ ] $paprika = 1/2 tsp paprika$
- [ ] $salt = salt to taste$
- [ ] $lemon = lemon wedges, for serving$
- [ ] $oil = 48 oz vegetable or canola oil, 2+ inches in saucepan for frying$

## Instructions
1. Add $flour$, $garlic_powder$, $onion_powder$, $paprika$, and a pinch of $salt$ to a medium bowl. Whisk in $beer$ until smooth. Let the batter rest for 10 minutes while prepping the fish. The foam should subside entirely
2. Place $dredging_flour$ in a shallow bowl. Set aside
3. In a Dutch oven or saucepan, bring $oil$ to 365°F. This recipe works best if the fish is completely submerged in oil
4. Meanwhile, cut $fish$ into equal portions, pat dry with a paper towel, and season with $salt$ and pepper
5. Dredge $fish$ in $dredging_flour$, and then submerge in the beer batter. Remove, let excess drip off, and immediately transfer to the hot oil
6. Deep fry each piece for 4-5 minutes, flipping halfway through if not completely submerged in oil
7. Remove fish with a slotted spoon or spider strainer and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain for 5 minutes before serving
8. Serve with $lemon$, ketchup, tartar sauce, and fries of choice
