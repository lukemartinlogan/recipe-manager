# Sesame Balls

## Ingredients
- [ ] $rice_flour = 3/4 cup glutinous rice flour$
- [ ] $water = 6 Tbsp water (3/8 cup)$
- [ ] $sesame_oil = 1 tsp sesame oil$
- [ ] $red_bean_paste = 1/4 cup Koshi-an (sweet Azuki red bean paste)$
- [ ] $sesame_seeds = toasted white sesame seeds$

## Instructions
1. Place the $rice_flour$ in a bowl. Add the $water$ and mix very well until smooth. Add the $sesame_oil$ and mix well until combined.
2. Divide the $red_bean_paste$ into 8 equal portions, roll them into balls. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, and roll them into balls as well. Flatten out the dough with your fingers, and wrap the red bean paste securely.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Gently drop the dumplings in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the boiling water and transfer into cold water (to cool and remove the slimy texture).
4. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C).
5. Lightly drain the dumplings and coat with $sesame_seeds$.
6. Bake for 7 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.
