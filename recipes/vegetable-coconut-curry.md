- 1/2 medium yellow onion diced (~1/2 cup)

- Fine sea salt and freshly cracked pepper
- 1 can (13.5 oz.) full-fat coconut milk (NOT lite)
- 1 tablespoon lime juice

## Instructions
1. Dice 1 onion and cut bell pepper into strips
2. Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces and season with salt + pepper
3. Add jasmine rice to the cooker
4. Heat 2tbsp coconut oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat
5. Add the onion, pepper, and saute for 3-5 minutes or until onions begin to turn golden. Add 1tbsp minced garlic and 2tbsp ginger; stir to coat everything with the oil
